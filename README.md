# CKAD Learning Journey

Welcome to my CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer) learning journey repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting my progress, notes, and practical exercises as I prepare for the CKAD certification.

## About Me

I'm Saim Talha, and this repository serves as a comprehensive record of my hands-on experience with Kubernetes, specifically tailored for the CKAD exam. You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saim-talha/).

## Key Learning Areas

This repository covers a wide range of CKAD topics, including:

* **Core Concepts:** Pods, Deployments, Services, ReplicaSets, and Namespaces.
* **Configuration:** ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Resource Management.
* **Networking:** Network Policies, Ingress, and Service Types.
* **Storage:** Understanding volumes and persistent storage.
* **Security:** Security Contexts, Service Accounts, and RBAC.
* **Observability:** Liveness and Readiness Probes, and Logging.
* **Workloads:** Jobs, CronJobs, and Init Containers.
* **Scheduling:** Node Selectors, Node Affinity, and Taints/Tolerations.
* **Deployment Strategies:** Rolling Updates, Blue/Green Deployments, and Canary Deployments.
* **Imperative vs. Declarative Management:** Demonstrating both approaches.

## Content Details

* **Comprehensive Notes:** I've meticulously prepared a 60-page study guide, available here: [CKAD Notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/122Rcqn1ym10Csx06Am2YrNEM0eDjpqiz/view?usp=drive_link). This document encapsulates my key takeaways and summaries for a more structured learning experience.
* **`cluster-config.yml` and `network-CNI.yaml`:** Configuration files related to cluster setup and networking.
* **`yaml-configurations/`:** This directory contains numerous YAML files that demonstrate various Kubernetes concepts and configurations. Each subdirectory focuses on a specific CKAD topic, providing practical examples and hands-on experience.
